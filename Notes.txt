1️⃣ HR: Tell me about yourself.
🟢 Answer:
Sure! I’m a software engineer with over nine years of professional experience, currently working at Domino’s Pizza Enterprises in the Netherlands.
I’ve mainly focused on building scalable microservices and cloud-based systems, recently leading a migration from AWS to Azure with zero downtime.
Before Domino’s, I worked at Coolblue, where I designed and maintained high-performance services that handled millions of daily transactions.
I really enjoy working in collaborative environments, improving systems’ reliability, and mentoring others.
Outside of work, I’m passionate about music and board games — they help me unwind and stay creative.

2️⃣ HR: Why are you interested in this position / our company?
🟢 Answer:
I’m drawn to companies that value scalability, clean architecture, and innovation — all things I see in your organization.
I also appreciate environments that encourage learning and cross-team collaboration.
Given my experience with cloud migration, distributed systems, and performance optimization, I believe I could make a meaningful impact while continuing to grow technically.

3️⃣ HR: What are your strengths?
🟢 Answer:
I’d say my strengths are problem-solving, attention to detail, and adaptability.
I’ve worked on large-scale systems with millions of daily transactions, so I’ve learned how to balance performance, maintainability, and reliability.
I also communicate well with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, which helps in aligning everyone toward a shared goal.

4️⃣ HR: What are your weaknesses?
🟢 Answer:
I tend to work quite fast, which sometimes makes me overlook smaller details. 
I’ve been actively working on finding the right balance — not being too much of a perfectionist, but also not rushing through tasks.

Another thing I’ve noticed is that frequent context switching can sometimes make me forget minor things, 
so I’ve built a habit of taking structured notes to stay organized and avoid losing track.

Culturally, I also used to hold back from expressing my opinions directly — I believed that “silence is golden.” 
But after moving to the Netherlands, I realized that open and direct communication is actually a strength. 
I’ve been consciously improving this, and it’s helped me collaborate more effectively with international teams.

5️⃣ HR: What are your career goals?
🟢 Answer:
In the short term, I want to deepen my cloud and system design expertise, especially in Azure and distributed architectures.
In the long run, I’d like to move into a technical leadership role where I can guide architecture decisions and mentor other developers.

6️⃣ HR: Why did you leave your previous company?
🟢 Answer:
Unfortunately, my current company is undergoing a major reorganization.
Until recently, Domino’s had engineering teams in Australia, Europe, and Malaysia.
After a change in leadership, the company decided to centralize all development in Malaysia to reduce costs and reallocate resources 
toward marketing and advertising.
As part of this global restructuring, the European engineering department — including my role — is being closed.

7️⃣ HR: How do you handle conflicts in a team?
🟢 Answer:
I focus on understanding the root of the issue — whether it’s a technical disagreement or a communication gap.
I listen actively, clarify assumptions, and try to bring data or examples to guide the discussion objectively.
I believe in respectful, solution-oriented communication — and I’ve found that most conflicts are resolved quickly with transparency.

8️⃣ HR: Describe a project you’re proud of.
🟢 Answer:
At Paynet, I led the migration from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture.
It was a major challenge involving scalability, compliance, and modernization.
The result was a far more resilient and maintainable payment infrastructure that handled higher loads and supported faster development cycles.
That project really shaped how I think about system design today.

9️⃣ HR: What motivates you at work?
🟢 Answer:
I’m motivated by solving complex technical problems and seeing the real-world impact of my work.
When I see a system performing smoothly or teams collaborating better because of something I built — that’s very rewarding.
Continuous learning is also a big motivator for me.




🟩 Think Customer First

In every project I’ve worked on, I always start by understanding how the change will impact the end user.
For example, at Domino’s, when optimizing APIs that served 3,500+ stores, I focused on improving response times and reducing downtime, because even small delays directly affected store operations and customer satisfaction.
For me, technical excellence only matters if it improves the customer experience.

🟩 Own It

I always take ownership of what I build — from design to production.
If an incident happens, I don’t wait for someone else to fix it; I dig into logs, find the root cause, and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
I see ownership as not just responsibility, but also pride in the outcome.
